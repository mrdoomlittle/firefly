I'm only working on this engine because i just enjoy making shit,
also the reason why im not using libc or other librarys is because its
more enjoyable attempting to remake them.

lots of things have been quickly made as ive been working on
all parts of the engine and switching midway as a result allocr, dep/mem_cpy.s, ...
are not going to be changing any time soon or are going to be left in a bad condition
as i havent got the time because i want to get it up and working for now then later
work will be done on them.

this engine is for a game im wanting to make.
