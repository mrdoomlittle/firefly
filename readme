I'm only working on this engine because i just enjoy making shit.
compile & run:
- src/main.c -
this is for testing object, universe, camera.
cd src && make uni

execute: ./a.out 

then go to /src/graphics
do sh bridge.sh

and then ./a.out and a window should pop up
to exit click any where with mouse

NOTE: this is only for debugging until everything is done

- src/ff-lang.c -
firefly language.
cd src && make ffc

execute: ./ffc

- src/script.c -
firefly script
cd src && make script

execute: ./main

look for compile.sh as i use it to compile src/as, src/bond, etc
