I'm only working on this engine because i just enjoy making shit,
also the reason why im not using libc or other librarys is because its
more enjoyable attempting to remake them.

and lots of things have been quickly made as ive been working on
all parts of the engine and switching midway as a result allocr, dep/mem_cpy.s, ...
are not going to be changing any time soon or are going to be left in a bad condition
as i havent got the time because i want to get it up and working for now then later
work will be done on them.

compile & run:
- src/main.c -
this is for testing object, universe, camera.
cd src && make uni

execute: ./a.out 

then go to /src/graphics
do sh bridge.sh

and then ./a.out and a window should pop up
to exit click any where with mouse

NOTE: this is only for debugging until everything is done

- src/ff-lang.c -
firefly language.
cd src && make ffc

execute: ./ffc

- src/script.c -
firefly script
cd src && make script

execute: ./main

look for compile.sh as i use it to compile src/as, src/bond, etc

system:
