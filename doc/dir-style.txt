external projects:
	
	{project name}/project_name.c/h

inner projects or shit:
	{project name}/all files.c/h
	{project_name}../project_name.c/h

if the main file is going to be accessed from inside the engine then the core file
so {project}.h/c should be placed back a directory

for things that are external like 'src/as' in this case its okay to place the main as.h/c file 
within the main directory.
