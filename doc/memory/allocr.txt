src/memory/allocr.h:

this is low level and all memory allocations
should be made thru the intended way.

c-style
{
	ffly_alloc(<memory region size>);

	ffly_free(<memory pointer>);

	ffly_realloc(<old pointer>, <new size>);

	should be used to trim a small amount off
	ffly_arsh(<pointer>, <new size>);	-	shrink memory block
	ffly_argr(<pointer>, <new size>);	-	grow memory block

	ffly_arbl(<pointer>);	-	get infomation on a block

	shoud only be used when pot and sub pots are empty, as
	it will lead to memory leakages.
	ffly_araxe(<pot pointer>);	-	kill off pot and sub pots
}
