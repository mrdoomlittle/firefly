i dont know how to get around this but im using defines so resymbol function names

so

#define _test_func(...)\
	ffly_test_func(__VA_ARGS__)

i would do this with the function but the issue is that symbols may collide at the linker level and or asm level
and i dont want 'ffly_' part as it makes the code look to big when it comes to single line
