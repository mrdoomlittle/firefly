-. clean up code
-. work on pixdraw pixcopy pixfill
-. remove some submodules
-. remake object manager
-. remake ffly studio
-. change src/system/flags.c from c to asmbaly
-. work on math functions
-. fpu might not support sqrt so need to make fall back
-. add lookup table for sqrt and other math functions
-. get asla up and running
-. rename graphics/png_loader.c/h to png.c/h same goes for jpeg loader
-. add support for saving images such as png and jpeg
-. clean up and improve task pool
-. allow for functions such as mem_cmp to use task pool to improve speed for large compares
-. need to find out how calulate a size to speed ratio for mem_cpy slice size as fixing it as one size would cause issus for other machines with a slow cpu clock.
-. need to start working on graphics function for 2d and 3d.
-. get opencl working with graphics functions.
-. add fall back to cpu if gpu becomes unavailable or cl library wasn't stated at compile time
-. document shit
-. remove old code
-. add multithreading support for pixdraw/pixfill/etc
-. start adding to errno list
-. cleanup & test shm, system pipe.
-. work on database.
-. allow for vec & buff as a option to be allocated in pages of non contiguous memory.
-. work on terminal,hatch to make debugging easer. this will allow a live view on infomation from within engine
	e.g. memory, opened files, threads etc.
-. remove useless submodules
-. make somthing to parse args from argv main to reduce copy and past
-. clean up const* shit as alot i havent updated and its all loose
-. c++ side might not work as its outofdate and need updating
-. huge improvments need to be made
-. reduce number of syscalls
-. for system/file add out and input buffers to reduce the amount of times write and read are called
-. revise code as lots of shit isent the best way of doing things
-. allocr needs to be improved at the moment i dont care if its using large amount of memory but needs fixing
-. get clock working
-. the compiler needs working on and cleaning up.
-. allow diffrent syntax formats for compiler also get started c-lang and use bci for testing
-. allocr and multithreading needs testing
-. start making headers for uapi 
example:

header.h
{
	make it so when using uapi 
	it descards structures
	and diffrent ones will be put in there place
	struct test {
		mdl_uint_t size;
	};

	struct test{
		mdl_uint_t tst_size;
	};

	# define __uapi
	# include "../header.h"
}
-. everthing is a total mess and lots of work is needed but dont have the necessary time to do so.
-. testing things like object shit might be a problem as we cant use cuda or x11 xcb as it relies on libc
so we will use the terminal until we can get it up and working.
-. work on module malloc
-. db needs testing and improvements need to be made
-. as and bond are a total mess and it needs to be fixed.
-. fix printf as for now ive been using a fixed buffer, change!
-. sending kill signal will cause thread issues 
	if killed inside lock or somthing else - need to fix.

-. pulse, alsa, xcb, x11 require libc so
we will pipe data back for forth using shared memory
until we can do somthing about that.
-. ffly_mem_cpy, ffly_mem_set, etc under 'data' is to be renamed to ff_mem_cpy
-. stack neededs to be alligned to 16 bytes, either allign it on init and keep it alligned
	or allign it before printf calles but the problem might
	pop up when using double precision floats if movaps happens to be used - need to be fixed.
