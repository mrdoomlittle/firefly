-> rename networking / *_server *_client to *server_poxix *client_poxix
-> when user uses ctrl_c have it so if its pressed 2 times it will force the program to close.
-> when getting the pointers for a btn_t from the btn_manager if a button has been added the pointer will change as 
the vector gets resized, fix alloc memory for each btn_t and store it in the vector as a pointer.

NEW
-> it seems like the window buffer memory initalizes to late so for now use 'while(window.get_pixbuff() == nullptr){}'
if this is not used for studio draw functions wont work and will fail. <- need to fix this as it seems like 'while(window.wd_handler.is_wd_flag(WD_CLOSED)) {}'
does not work event know it gets set after the memory for the pixbuff get inited.
