-. theres still alot to do and lots needs fixing.
-. for subprograms like as, bond, etc that are external entities
all with ffly_* should be avoided e.g. ffly_mem_cpy should be memcpy from src/string.h not src/dep/mem_cpy.h

pixel format:
	we should work in only r,b,g,a, but when needed to work in another we will just convert it but
	that should be left for higher level functions.

security:
	dont care, just leads more work when changing things later and can be left until its actually needed.
	e.g. db msg kind picks from list of pointers to jmp to 
	major security issue but it can be dont later when the security is needed;

memory:
	things can break most likely cause would be 'allocr' as it hasent been tested at large,
	only small tests have been performed.

firefly lang for resin is broken.

naming:
	i cant name for shit so i just pick a word that has a correlation with the thing im trying to build,
	e.g. slurry <- {i dont know}{fluid composed of a pulverized solid/mixture of pulverized solids}{mixture}
	so a mixture of things. i dont realy care about naming shit because it can be renamed later might take some 
	work but it beats doing nothing while trying to pick a name.

	look i dont know and dont give a fuck.
testing:
	tests are performed at a bare level or not at all

process:
	use as less time as possible
	make and done <- no testing dents can be fixed later
