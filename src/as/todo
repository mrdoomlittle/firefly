remove _o_label

for multiple fixes say
call $test0
call $test1

we should keep track of prev fixes to keep them within the same fragment as we dont want 
a large amount of small fragments because it would be a wast of memory

local labels:
	.l 0
	.l 1
store local labels in array 0-... and not in hash table


MAJOR:
	fragment

remove '\0' from remf names
