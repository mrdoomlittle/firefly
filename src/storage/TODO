resv and cistern

locking needs to be redone why?
it was done for quick implementation so locking is 
most certainly slow as fuck this applys to everything thats using them
but here is more crucial.

resv:
	rename slab to rv_slab or resv_slab

	and not ffly_slab

resv and cistern:
	allow for linear memory to be allocated if r/w need to be fast but all should be aligned to slab size,
	this should be provided as an option.
